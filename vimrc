" Backspace behaviour in vim
" to make it work like "other" programs
"
set backspace=indent,eol,start
"

"Longer answer
"
"Though the default behaviour may be surprising, the backspace "not working"
"can be considered a feature; it can prevents you from accidentally removing
"indentation, and from removing too much text by restricting it to the current
"line and/or the start of the insert.
"
":help 'backspace' tells us:
"
"Influences the working of `<BS>`, `<Del>`, `CTRL-W` and `CTRL-U` in Insert
"mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
"a way to backspace over something:
"
"value     effect
"indent    allow backspacing over autoindent
"eol       allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
"start     allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
"          stop once at the start of insert.
